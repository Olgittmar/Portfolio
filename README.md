# Portfolio
This project is intended as a platform for me (Olgittmar) to learn new programming concept and languages
in a structured manner. I may also use it as part of job applications as a workaround to my inability to perform well
in timed programming tests.
As my coding experience grows, I will add more languages, programs and problems to the project.

Feedback and tips on coding patterns, algorithm choices and general code improvements are welcome.

## Python
A simple command line interface for running solutions to coding puzzles.
### Point in polygon
Given the vertices of a polygon, and a number of points, checks whether each point is inside, outside or on the edge of the polygon.

## CPlusPlus
A simple GUI for running solutions to coding puzzles with specified input and output.
(GUI allows textfile I/O for now, but further down the line I might expand to other options such as real-time evaluation, CLI etc.)
### Point in polygon
Given the vertices of a polygon, and a number of points, checks whether each point is inside, outside or on the edge of the polygon and returns a string with the results.
